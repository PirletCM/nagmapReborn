# NagMap Reborn Introduction
NagMap Reborn is based on NagMap project developed by [Marcel Hecko](https://github.com/hecko) which according to his own description is an "... super-simple application to integrate Nagios or Icinga with Google maps. The integration aims to visualize current status of network devices on aerial photography images..."

## ATTENTION
