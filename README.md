NagMap Reborn Introduction
=====
NagMap Reborn is an initiative to improve the original project NagMap which according to his own description is an "... super-simple application to integrate Nagios or Icinga with Google maps. The integration aims to visualize current status of network devices on aerial photography images. It also aims to give administrator basic information on devices to do further investigation of their status, such as links to MRTG and Smokeping pages of respected devices."
